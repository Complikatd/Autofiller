# Autofiller
My first program, it can store passwords in a file and encrypt the file automatically. It can also retrieve a password that was saved to file by receiving the username for the password as input. It copies the password to your clipboard for easy pasting. I've also implemented a remove password method which takes a username as input. Notice the deletePass method only deletes the first instance of the username linked with a password. If you've stored more than one password with the same username you'll have to run this program more than once. You can change the key used to encrypt by changing the 'key' variable in each function. Notice that you will have to export the program to a .exe yourself afterwards.


Later on I plan on having a key generator do all the work to make the files even more secure, but for now it's a quick and easy tool for anyones pc.
